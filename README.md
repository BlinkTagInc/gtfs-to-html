[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gtfs-to-html.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gtfs-to-html/)

`gtfs-to-html` creates human-readable, user-friendly transit timetables in HTML format directly from [GTFS transit data](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/). Most transit agencies have schedule data in GTFS format but need to show each route's schedule to users on a website. This project automates the process of creating nicely formatted HTML timetables for inclusion on a transit agency website. This makes it easy to keep timetables up to date and accurate when schedule changes happen and reduces the likelihood of errors.


### Configurable and customizable
`gtfs-to-html` has many options that configure how timetables are presented. It also allows using a completely custom template which makes it easy to build chunks of HTML that will fit perfectly into any website using any HTML structure and classes that you'd like.

### Accessibility for all
`gtfs-to-html` properly formats timetables to ensure they are screen-reader accessible and WCAG 2.0 compliant.

### Mobile responsiveness built in
Built-in styling makes `gtfs-to-html` timetables ready to size and scroll easily on mobile phones and tablets.

### Schedule changes? A cinch.
By generating future timetables and including dates in table metadata, your timetables can appear in advance of a schedule change, and you can validate that your new timetables and GTFS are correct.

## Auto-generated maps
`gtfs-to-html` can also generate a map for each route that can be included with the schedule page. The map shows all stops for the route and lists all routes that serve each stop. See the `showMap` configuration option below. If you'd rather just get all stops and route info as geoJSON, check out the  [gtfs-to-geojson](https://github.com/blinktaginc/gtfs-to-geojson) package.

`gtfs-to-html` uses the [`node-gtfs`](https://github.com/blinktaginc/node-gtfs) library to handle importing and querying GTFS data.

## Current Usage
Many transit agencies use `gtfs-to-html` to generate the schedule pages used on their websites, including:

* [Advance Transit](https://advancetransit.com/)
* [Capital Transit (Juneau)](https://juneaucapitaltransit.org/)
* [County Connection (Contra Costa County, California)](https://countyconnection.com)
* [El Dorado County](http://eldoradotransit.com/)
* [Humboldt Transit Authority](http://hta.org/)
* [Kings Area Rural Transit (KART)](http://mykartbus.com/)
* [Madera County Connection](http://mcctransit.com/)
* [Marin Transit](https://marintransit.org/)
* [Mountain Transit](http://mountaintransit.org/)
* [NW Connector (Oregon)](http://www.nworegontransit.org/)
* [Palo Verde Valley Transit Agency](http://pvvta.com/)
* [Petaluma Transit](http://transit.cityofpetaluma.net/)

## Installation

If you would like to use this library as a command-line utility, you can install it globally directly from [npm](https://npmjs.org):

    npm install gtfs-to-html -g

If you are using this as a node module as part of an application, you can include it in your project's `package.json` file.

## Command-line example

    gtfs-to-html --configPath /path/to/your/custom-config.json

## Code example

    const gtfsToHTML = require('gtfs-to-html');
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    const config = require('config.json');

    mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
    mongoose.connect(config.mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true });

    gtfsToHTML(config)
    .then(() => {
      console.log('HTML Generation Successful');
      process.exit();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
    });

## Configuration

Copy `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and then add your projects configuration to `config.json`. This is a JSON file, so ensure that your config.json is valid JSON.

    cp config-sample.json config.json

All files starting with `config*.json` are .gitignored - so you can create multiple configuration files such as `config-caltrain.json`.

### agencies

{Array} Specify the GTFS files to be imported in an `agencies` array. GTFS files can be imported via a `url` or a local `path`.

Each file needs an `agency_key`, a short name you create that is specific to that GTFS file. For GTFS files that contain more than one agency, you only need to list each GTFS file once in the `agencies` array, not once per agency that it contains.

To find an agency's GTFS file, visit [transitfeeds.com](http://transitfeeds.com). You can use the
URL from the agency's website or you can use a URL generated from the transitfeeds.com
API along with your API token.

## Build `timetables.txt`

This project supports an additional non-standard file `timetables.txt` which can be included in an agency's GTFS. This file specifies to GTFS-to-HTML which HTML timetables should be built.

An example of this file is located in [examples/timetables.txt](examples/timetables.txt). The format of this file is:

| column name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `timetable_id` | A unique ID for the timetable |
| `route_id` | The ID of the route the timetable is for from `routes.txt`. |
| `direction_id` | The `direction_id` from `trips.txt` for the timetable. This can be blank. |
| `start_date` | The start date for this timetable in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
| `end_date` | The end date for this timetable in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
| `monday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Mondays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `tuesday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Tuesdays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `wednesday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Wednesdays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `thursday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Thursdays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `friday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Fridays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `saturday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Saturdays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `sunday` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should include service on Sundays. Valid options are `0` and `1`. |
| `include_exceptions` | A binary value that indicates whether or not to include exceptions of type `1` from `calendar_dates.txt`, such as holiday service on a weekday. Valid options are `0` and `1`. Optional, defaults to `0` (exceptions are not included by default). |
| `timetable_label` | A short text label describing the timetable, for instance "Route 4 Northbound Mon-Fri". Optional, defaults to route name and first and last stops. |
| `service_notes` | Text shown on the timetable about the service represented. Optional. |
| `orientation` | Determines if the top row should be a list of trips or stops. Valid options are `vertical`, `horizontal` or `hourly`. `vertical` shows stops across the top row with each row being a list of stop times for each trip. `horizontal` shows trips across the top row with each row being stop times for a specific stop. `hourly` is for routes that run the same time each hour and will print a simplified schedule showing minutes after the hour for each stop. `horizontal` orientation is best for routes with lots of stops and fewer trips while `vertical` orientation is best for routes with lots of trips and a smaller number of stops. Default is `vertical` |
| `timetable_page_id` | The timetable page to include this timetable on |
| `timetable_sequence` | The order that this timetable should appear on the timetable page |
| `direction_name` | The human readable name of the direction of the timetable, such as "Southbound" |
| `show_trip_continuation` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should show an additional column(s) or row(s) indicating which trips continue from a different route or continue on as a different route. This is calculated by trips that share the same `block_id` in `trips.txt`. Valid options are `0` and `1`.  Optional, defaults to `0`. |


### Multi-route Timetables

To allow creating a single timetable for multiple routes that overlap, you can have multiple entries in `timetables.txt` for the same `timetable_id`. These multi-route entries should have the same values `timetable_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, calendar date, `service_notes` and `orientation` fields and should have different values for the `route_id` and `timetable_label` fields.

### Build `timetable_stop_order.txt`

This is an optional file that can specify stop order for a particular timetable. It is useful when generating combined timetables for multiple overlapping routes, or exerting fine-grained control on stop order.

An example of this file is located in [examples/timetable_stop_order.txt](examples/timetable_stop_order.txt). The format of this file is:

| column name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `timetable_id` | The ID of the timetable from `timetables.txt` |
| `stop_id` | The ID of the stop from `stops.txt`. |
| `stop_sequence` | An assigned integer identifying the order of stops to be presented in the timetable. The values for `stop_sequence` must be non-negative integers, and they must increase along the trip. This value does not need to match the `stop_sequence` found in `stop_times.txt`. |

#### Stops with different arrival and departure times

Stoptimes with different arrival and departure times will be shown twice in a row and labeled as "(arrival)" and "(departure)".

## Build `timetable_pages.txt`

This project supports an additional non-standard file `timetable_pages.txt` which can be included in an agency's GTFS. This file specifies which HTML timetable to group together into a single HTML page.

An example of this file is located in [examples/timetable_pages.txt](examples/timetable_pages.txt). The format of this file is:

| column name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `timetable_page_id` | A unique ID for the timetable page |
| `timetable_page_label` | A label that will show up on the top of the page. Optional, defaults to using route name. |
| `filename` | The filename to use for the generated HTML file. Optional, defaults to `timetable_page_id` with file extension `.html`, for example `1.html`. |

## Build `stop_attributes.txt`

This is an optional file which can be included in an agency's GTFS to include additional information about specific stops. This can be used when styling timetables to add additional useful information not included in GTFS, such as the city that the stop is in

An example of this file is located in [examples/stop_attributes.txt](examples/stop_attributes.txt). This feature is in development and additional fields may be added or changes to the way this works could happen in the future.

The format of this file is:

| column name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `stop_id` | A `stop_id` from `stops.txt` |
| `stop_city` | The name of the city or region that the stop is in. |

## Running

Ensure than MongoDB is running locally.

    mongod

To generate HTML timetables, run `gtfs-to-html`.

    gtfs-to-html

By default, `gtfs-to-html` will look for a `config.json` file in the project root. To specify a different path for the configuration file:

    gtfs-to-html --configPath /path/to/your/custom-config.json

This will download the GTFS file specified in `config.js` .  Then, `gtfs-to-html` will build the HTML timetables and save them in `html/:agency_key`.

### Options

`configPath`

Allows specifying a configuration json file. Defaults to config.json in the current directory.

    gtfs-to-html --configPath /path/to/your/custom-config.json

`skipImport`

Skips importing GTFS into MongoDB. Useful if you are rerunning with an unchanged GTFS file. If you use this option and the GTFS file hasn't been imported, you'll get an error.

    gtfs-to-html --skipImport

## Processing very large GTFS files.

By default, node has a memory limit of 512 MB or 1 GB. If you have a very large GTFS file and want to use the option `showOnlyTimepoint` = `false` you may need to allocate more memory. Use the `max-old-space-size` option. For example to allocate 2 GB:

    node --max-old-space-size=2000 /usr/local/bin/gtfs-to-html

## Logging

If you want to route logs to a custom function, you can pass a function that takes a single `text` argument as `logFunction`. This con't be defined in `config.json` but instead passed in a config object to `gtfsToHtml()`.  For example:

    const gtfsToHTML = require('gtfs-to-html');
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    
    const config = {
      mongoUrl: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/gtfs',
      agencies: [
        {
          agency_key: 'county-connection',
          url: 'http://countyconnection.com/GTFS/google_transit.zip',
          exclude: [
            'shapes'
          ]
        }
      ],
      logFunction: function(text) {
        // Do something with the logs here, like save it or send it somewhere
        console.log(text);
      }
    };

    mongoose.connect(config.mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true });

    gtfsToHTML(config);

An example Express application that uses `gtfs-to-html` is included in the `app` folder.

After an initial run of `gtfs-to-html`, the GTFS data will be downloaded and loaded into MongoDB.

You can view an individual route HTML on demand by running the included Express app:

    node app

By default, `gtfs-to-html` will look for a `config.json` file in the project root. To specify a different path for the configuration file:

    node app --configPath /path/to/your/custom-config.json

Once running, you can view the HTML in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Reviewing changes in HTML timetables

When an agency releases an updated GTFS file, it can be useful to review what has changed when generating HTML timetables. Use `diff2html` to easily compare two folders of html timetables.

First generate two folders of `gtfs-to-html` output to compare. To make it easy to see what has changed, set the `beautify` option to `true` in the config file for both sets of output.

Then, install diff2html:

    npm install -g diff2html-cli

Use the `diff` command and pipe the output to `diff2html` to get a nicely formatted list of the differences between two folders of html files.

    diff -bur html/folder1 html/folder2 |  diff2html -i stdin
