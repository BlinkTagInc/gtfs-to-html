## Multi-route Timetables

To allow creating a single timetable for multiple routes that overlap, you can have multiple entries in `timetables.txt` for the same `timetable_id`. All fields should be the same for each row in `timetables.txt` for a combined route timetable except `route_id`.

### Multi-route example

In this example, only one timetable will be generated that will include trips from route_ids `2034`, `2035` and `2036`.
