| `show_trip_continuation` | A binary value that indicates whether this timetable should show an additional column(s) or row(s) indicating which trips continue from a different route or continue on as a different route. This is calculated by trips that share the same `block_id` in `trips.txt`. Valid options are `0` and `1`. Optional, defaults to `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Multi-route Timetables

To allow creating a single timetable for multiple routes that overlap, you can have multiple entries in `timetables.txt` for the same `timetable_id`. All fields should be the same for each row in `timetables.txt` for a combined route timetable except `route_id`.

### Multi-route example

In this example, only one timetable will be generated that will include trips from route_ids `2034`, `2035` and `2036`.
