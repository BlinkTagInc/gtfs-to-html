id: timetable-notes
title: timetable_notes.txt
---

This is an optional, non-standard file called `timetable_notes.txt`. This file specifies notes about specific stops, trips, stoptimes, routes or timetables that should be included in the HTML output of a timetable.

The symbol and text of each note is defined in this file while the locations that each note should be placed is defined in [`timetable_notes_references.txt`](/docs/timetable-notes-references). This allows one note to be used in multiple places, such as two different trips, without having to duplicate the text of the note multiple times.

Notes can have a `symbol` specified or can be left blank and GTFS-to-HTML will assign a letter a-z to each note (falling back to using integers if more than 26 symbols are needed).
