A new version of [run.gtfstohtml.com](https://run.gtfstohtml.com) is live. This is an easy way to use GTFS-to-HTML entirely from your browser without needing to download any code or use the command line.

GTFS-to-HTML as a Service allows uploading a GTFS file or specifying a URL to a GTFS file. Almost all configuration options are supported, with the big exception being no support for [Custom Templates](https://gtfstohtml.com/docs/custom-templates).

The code to run GTFS-to-HTML as a service is [available on github](https://github.com/BlinkTagInc/gtfs-to-html-service).
